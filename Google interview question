//Given a word, find the length of the longest subset word without repeating characters.
keyWord = "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"

//pretend this array has every word in the dictionary
dictionary = ["poop", "butt", "cat", "dog", "fart", "frog"]

//GO!!!

function to find if specific letter is in keyWord and returns it's index or -1 if it does not exist.
  variable that stores that index
  loop function that supplies each letter of a given word and checks,
  if the returned index is -1 it breaks and returns false,
  if index number returned is less than the previous index number it returns false,
  else not it stores the new index number
  if we reached the last letter of the given word and it passes, returns true
    function that can check any word and return true if it is a subset of the keyWord
    given true it will add the word to a new list.
    once completed start a new code
    
      check for repeating characters in each word. if it has repeats. delete it. or only add words without repeats to a new list.
    
longestSubset = " "
longestLength = 0
check length of every word in list and compare it to the current longest length. if we found a longer one, replace longestLength and longestSubset
print(longestSubset + "=" + longestLength)
